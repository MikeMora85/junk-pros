My app USED to work, but after a previous prompt where you added Cloudinary image handling, the right-hand preview in Replit/Lovable only shows a blank white screen during development. HOWEVER, when I publish/deploy the app, the live site works. That means my production build is fine but the development/preview environment is broken.

I do NOT know how to code, so you must fix this entirely yourself by editing the right files. Please follow these rules very carefully:

1. DO NOT refactor or rewrite large parts of the app.
2. DO NOT redesign the UI or change component structure.
3. DO NOT simplify or "optimize" the whole codebase.
4. ONLY fix what is necessary to:
   - make the dev server / preview work again, and 
   - make the Cloudinary integration stable in both dev and production.

Your job:

A) Detect the framework and environment:
- Automatically detect if this is Vite, Next.js, CRA, or something else.
- Inspect the dev server configuration (vite.config, next.config, package.json scripts, .replit, etc.).
- Make sure the dev server is actually starting and binding to the correct host/port for Replit/Lovable preview.

B) Fix the dev preview white screen:
- Find whatever is causing the dev server or dev build to fail while production still works.
- This may include HMR/WebSocket config, wrong host binding, CSP issues, or dev-only strictness.
- Fix only the minimal configuration necessary to get the preview to show the running app again.
- If this is Vite, ensure server config uses host:true or equivalent and the correct port for the Replit environment.

C) Audit and repair Cloudinary integration:
- Find all Cloudinary-related code that was added recently.
- Check for:
  - Client-side Cloudinary config that should only run on the server.
  - Usage of environment variables that may be undefined in dev.
  - Any code that would crash in dev mode but not in a built production bundle.
- Make Cloudinary usage safe:
  - Never crash the dev environment if env variables are missing.
  - Guard Cloudinary code so it only runs where appropriate (e.g., only when window is defined or only on the server).
  - If necessary, create a separate utility module for Cloudinary and ensure it is imported only in safe places.
- If something is clearly wrong or too complex for dev, wrap it in try/catch and fail gracefully instead of crashing the app.

D) Do NOT change my public UI or logic:
- Keep all pages, components, routes, and UI behavior exactly as they are in the working production version.
- Do NOT remove features, forms, or flows that already work.
- Do NOT rename or move component files unless absolutely required to fix a hard error, and if you must, explain exactly what you changed.

E) Use the WORKING production build as a reference:
- Compare behavior: if the deployed version renders fine, treat that as the correct reference.
- Make the dev environment match the working behavior as closely as possible.

F) After you make changes:
1. Start the dev server and confirm that:
   - The app renders correctly in the right-hand preview.
   - There is no blank white screen.
2. Confirm that all existing core features of my junk removal directory still work in dev:
   - Listing profiles
   - Image displays
   - Any forms or calculators I had before you added Cloudinary
3. Confirm Cloudinary-related actions do NOT crash dev. If something can't be fully enabled safely, make it degrade gracefully with a clear message instead of a crash.

G) VERY IMPORTANT: Explain clearly what you changed.
- After you fix everything, give me a human-friendly summary in plain English:
  - Which files you edited
  - What the root cause of the white screen was
  - How you fixed it
  - Any limitations of the current Cloudinary setup I should know about

Again: Do NOT do big refactors. Focus only on making the dev preview work again and making the Cloudinary integration safe, with minimal, targeted changes.
