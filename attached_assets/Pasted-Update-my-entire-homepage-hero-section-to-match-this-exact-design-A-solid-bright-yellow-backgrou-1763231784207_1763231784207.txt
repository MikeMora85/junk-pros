Update my entire homepage hero section to match this exact design:

— A solid bright yellow background (#F7C948 or my existing site yellow).
— A large USA silhouette in a slightly lighter yellow behind the truck with a thin, subtle black outline (1–2px, low opacity).
— Place the USA silhouette centered and wide (full width on mobile).
— Place a tall-side-wall Isuzu NPR dump truck centered over the silhouette (use the same truck orientation as the mockup).
— Remove ANY old banner or hero images currently in the code.
— Remove the “SELECT” dropdown or anything left over from the old hero.
— The top headline should be large, bold, centered, and exactly:

Search Your Zip Code

— The sub-headline under it should be:

No National Franchises.
Local Vetted Junk Haulers Only.

Both in my original dark text color (almost black).

— Below that, include a large rounded search bar exactly like the mockup:
    • White background
    • Thick black outline
    • Gray placeholder text
    • A round yellow search button on the right, outlined in black
    • Add a slight shadow (subtle)

— After the search bar, rebuild my three feature cards to match the mockup:
    • White cards
    • Rounded large corners
    • Thin black outline (same as truck outline thickness)
    • Clean spacing and padding
    • Titles bold and centered
    • Sub-text centered, soft gray

Card Titles:
1. Local & Independent
2. Instant Quotes
3. Your Neighborhood Crew

Remove any icons or unnecessary graphics.

— Also REMOVE the state cards from the homepage entirely.
They should NOT appear anywhere on the homepage.

— Keep the menu icon/header EXACTLY as it is and DO NOT modify the navigation structure.

— Ensure perfect mobile responsiveness:
    • No horizontal scroll
    • Proper spacing above/below the hero section
    • Text centered and proportional like the mockup.

This new hero should match the provided yellow NPR truck + USA silhouette design visually and structurally. Use only native HTML/CSS already in the project, don’t add frameworks.
