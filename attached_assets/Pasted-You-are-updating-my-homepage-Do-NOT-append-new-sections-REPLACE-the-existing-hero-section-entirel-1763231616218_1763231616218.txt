You are updating my homepage. Do NOT append new sections — REPLACE the existing hero section entirely.

Here is what I want the homepage to look like exactly:

1. WHITE HEADER (Option 1)
- Background: white (#ffffff)
- Elements: my hamburger menu on the left, centered logo if applicable.
- A subtle bottom shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
- Make sure the header is fixed/sticky so it stays at the top.

2. HERO SECTION (REPLACE THE OLD HERO)
- Background: solid yellow (#F7C948 or the yellow in my current site)
- Add a USA silhouette behind the hero content:
  - Color: slightly lighter yellow (#F9D96C)
  - Add a very subtle black outline at 10% opacity
  - The silhouette should be centered and fill about 80% of the hero width.

- Add the NPR dump truck image with tall walls (I will upload image as hero-truck.png)
  - Center it horizontally
  - Position it slightly overlapping the USA silhouette
  - Size: about 300–360px wide on mobile
  - Add a mild drop shadow: 0 15px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.20)

- HEADLINE:
  Search Your Zip Code
  - Color: black
  - Weight: 700
  - Size: 34px on mobile
  - Center aligned

- SUBHEADLINE:
  No National Franchises.
  Local Vetted Junk Haulers Only.
  - Color: black
  - Weight: 400
  - Size: 18px
  - Center aligned
  - Max width: 85%

- SEARCH BAR:
  - White pill-shaped container
  - Border: 3px solid black
  - Full width minus 32px padding
  - Inside placeholder text: “search by zip code, city, state...”
    in #999999
  - Yellow search button on the right (#F7C948)
    with a black border
    and a black search icon inside.

3. REMOVE THIS SECTION COMPLETELY:
- State buttons
- State selection grid
- Any old hero image
- Any overlapping promotional cards
- ANYTHING ABOVE THE “Local & Independent” cards EXCEPT the new hero.

4. FEATURE CARDS — KEEP THESE EXACTLY LIKE MY MOCKUP:
- Three white cards stacked vertically
- Rounded corners: 20px
- Border: 2px solid black
- Drop shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
- Titles:
  Local & Independent
  Instant Quotes
  Your Neighborhood Crew
- Font sizes: Title 24px, Body 16px
- Color: black text

5. SPACING:
- Large spacing between sections (50–60px)
- Consistent mobile-friendly padding
- No overlapping elements

6. VERY IMPORTANT:
- Only use my ORIGINAL BRAND COLORS:
  Yellow: #F7C948 (primary)
  Black: #000000
  White: #ffffff
  Light Yellow Accent: #F9D96C
- NO blue anywhere.

Please update the HTML + CSS so the homepage EXACTLY matches this design.
Do NOT preserve the old hero section. Fully replace it.
