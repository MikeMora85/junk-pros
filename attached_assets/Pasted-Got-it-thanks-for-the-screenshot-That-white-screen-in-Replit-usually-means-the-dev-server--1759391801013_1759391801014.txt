Got it — thanks for the screenshot 🙏

That **white screen** in Replit usually means the dev server is technically running (no more blocked host error), but the React app isn’t rendering. This can happen for a few reasons:

---

## 🔹 Common Causes of White Screen in Vite + React (on Replit)

1. **Wrong port in preview**

   * By default, Vite runs on **port 5173** (not 5000).
   * Replit may be trying to show `:5000` but your app is on `:5173`.

2. **Mapbox or API errors**

   * If you left `mapboxAccessToken="YOUR_MAPBOX_TOKEN"` without a real token, the Map component will throw an error → blank screen.

3. **React runtime error**

   * Any small bug in `App.jsx` can break the whole render.
   * On Replit, the error may not show in Preview, only in the Console tab.

4. **Tailwind not set up**

   * If Tailwind CSS isn’t configured (`index.css`, `tailwind.config.js`), styles break.
   * This won’t usually cause a white screen, but will make things look wrong.

## 🔹 How to Fix

### Step 1. Check console for runtime errors

* In Replit, go to the **Console tab** (not Preview).
* If you see `ReferenceError` or `Mapbox error`, that’s the cause.

### Step 2. Confirm Vite port

* In `vite.config.js` add:

  ```js
  server: {
    port: 5000,
    host: true,
    allowedHosts: [".replit.dev", ".repl.co", "localhost"]
  }
  ```
* That forces Vite to run on **5000**, matching Replit Preview.

### Step 3. Remove Mapbox temporarily

* Comment out the `<Map>` block in `App.jsx` and just render `<h2>Map Placeholder</h2>`.
* If the app loads, you know the blank screen was Mapbox token related.

### Step 4. Tailwind Setup (if not done yet)

Make sure you have:

* `index.css`:

  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```
* `tailwind.config.js`:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
    theme: {
      extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
  }
  ```

✅ Quick Test:
Try setting `vite.config.js` to use port 5000, then reload Preview. If still blank, comment out the Mapbox component and check if everything else loads.

Do you want me to give you a **minimal working App.jsx (without Mapbox)** so you can confirm the rest of the site renders first? That way we isolate whether Mapbox is the blocker.
